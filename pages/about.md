## Overview

The Digital Library of Idaho (DLOI) is a collection of digital libraries from across the state of Idaho, providing access points to the varied historical images, documents, and other media available to the public. This "collection of collections" was developed over the course of the 2020-2021 academic year by a board of directors drawn from librarians from the University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University and the Idaho Commission for Libraries. The site currently features over 150 collections from 6 organizations from across the state that can be searched and browsed by subject matter, material type, date range, and location. 

The Digital Library of Idaho is the first initiative of the Network of Idaho Academic Libraries (NIAL), which seeks to increase the statewide impact of higher education by facilitating and strengthening collaboration and communication among Idahoâ€™s academic libraries.

## Future Directions

DLoI is currently a collection of collections, and the founding board members believe that focusing on collections and their importance to the state should be an ongoing principle of the organization. We also intend to expand the site's capacity to include aggregated item information from each collection as well. This will enable further advancements and features, including cross-state search functions, machine readable data formats, and improved ability to discover, teach, build, and create additional resources and expressions from the collections and their items.
