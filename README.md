The Digital Library of Idaho (DLOI) is a collection of digital libraries from across the state of Idaho, providing access points to the varied historical images, documents, and other media available to the public. 
This "collection of collections" was developed over the course of the 2020-2021 academic year by a board of directors drawn from librarians from the University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University and the Idaho Commission for Libraries. 
The site currently features over 150 collections from 6 organizations from across the state that can be searched and browsed by subject matter, material type, date range, and location. 

The site is built using [CollectionBuilder-CSV](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/collectionbuilder-csv).
